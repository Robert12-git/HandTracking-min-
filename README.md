                Hand Tracking (minimalistic version)

Python program which gets video input and tries to recognise
hands and in order to make sure that hand was analyzed,
a landmark appears based on principal hand points.

Opencv was used to get video input and mediapipe was used
in order to be able to use hands' modules.

How to run program:
* Modules required: python3, opencv, mediapipe
* Command to run: python3 <name.py>, user must be in directory with source code

When running:
* set time limit for program to run (in seconds)
* when running, hands landmarking appears live
